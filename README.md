# Needy Streamer Overload: Alternative Ascension

Alternative Ascension is a mod for Needy Streamer Overload aiming to expand the game similar to a content update. Similarly to the major update that added DARK ANGEL, three endings are included as of version 1.0. 

## Installation
1. Install Needy Streamer Overload, if you haven't done so already. It can be found [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1451940/NEEDY_STREAMER_OVERLOAD/)!
2. Install the BepInEx framework. I'd recommend following Frostworth's guide for this, which can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/amazeedaizee/ae0dd70cc0d842d6a83cd80451e3752e). 
3. Extract the mod content to `NEEDY GIRL OVERDOSE/BepInEx/plugins`.
4. Enjoy!
