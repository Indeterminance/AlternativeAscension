# Needy Streamer Overload: Alternative Ascension

Alternative Ascension is a mod for Needy Streamer Overload aiming to expand the game similar to a content update. Similarly to the major update that added DARK ANGEL, three endings are included as of version 1.0. 

## Installation
1. Install Needy Streamer Overload, if you haven't done so already. It can be found [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1451940/NEEDY_STREAMER_OVERLOAD/)!
2. Install the BepInEx framework. I'd recommend following Frostworth's guide for this, which can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/amazeedaizee/ae0dd70cc0d842d6a83cd80451e3752e). 
3. Extract the mod content to `NEEDY GIRL OVERDOSE/BepInEx/plugins`.
4. Enjoy!

## Ending requirements

<summary>FOLLOWERS</summary>
1. Go to a specific location available between Days 14-16. This location is only available above 250K followers, and should give a stream idea.<br>
2. On Day 16, stream the idea you obtained from the prior event.<br>
3. Anytime after Day 16, take a recommended dose of Depaz at night.<br>
4. Go out twice.<br>
5. Check /st/ for a special thread.<br>
6. Go out until you can't anymore. <br>

(Note that there's an alternative path, good luck finding it!)

Reach Day 30 after raising the Affection cap to 120 with at least 100 Affection and no missed JINE messages.

(Note that there's an extra scene at the end if you've already completed the game's true ending, which you should have already done if you're playing a mod!)

## Notice
Alternative Ascension seems to flag as a virus for some users. While these are false positives, a VirusTotal scan is provided [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/94955665be30e7678028cda2eb5ed4b50531437a856feee34369fccd1fa86b06), and I encourage you to run your own scans as well if you're not confident. Stay safe!

Additionally, I can't promise Alternative Ascension is compatible with any other mod (although hopefully it is!) If you're running multiple mods through BepInEx and AltAsc isn't working, try running with only AltAsc active!
